# FluentMigration
Managing database migrations is an important part of a project. 

Everyone on the team needs to be on the same page when it comes to the database, while still having the ability to make database changes when necessary. The idea with Fluent Migrator is to create a series of classes that create and modify the database schema (and data). 

Each class represents a single "migration" (in the sense that you are "migrating" from an empty database to a database with something in it).
